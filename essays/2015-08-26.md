My name is Saaya (pronounced sah-yah) and I am a junior studying accounting and now management information systems. I decided that I also want to pursue MIS because technology is becoming the backbone of a big part of our daily lives. I think we really started seeing this since COVID hit us. I have also been reading blogs, reddit posts, etc. on what major would really compliment accounting and MIS was a popular one. I am excited to see how these two fields of studies will compliment each other and strengthen my knowledge of business!
