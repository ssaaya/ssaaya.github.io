My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
I believe I am better at figuring out where my coding is going wrong. At the beginning of the semester, if my code wouldn't work out the way I want it to, I had no idea where to look. However now, I know where to look such as the console, and I understand the language a lot better. It can still take me a while, but there has been improvement. 

I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
I need to work on understanding the logic of code. I think my understanding of the logic is at a basic level but if I keep studying the screencasts and readings, and maybe even outside sources, I think I can really get better at it.

I can do the WODs without looking at the screencast solutions first:
Usually I can only do about half of the WODs before I get really stuck. Sometimes I just do not understand the instructions are saying as well.

The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
The labs definitely help. With coding, I believe the only way to learn is by actually doing it. I am not confident enough to do the whole thing by myself however. I need to double check with the zoom recordings.
 
I feel ready I am ready to work on the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications like Assignment 1):
I think I am ready, but I just need to keep reviewing lectures and readings.
 
I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
I think we need more complexity in Labs. We only go over the basic parts of certain concepts and the assignments push us to the limit. If we were given more complex problems in the labs, I believe it would set us up for success for the assignments.

These are things that work really well for my learning in this class:
I appreciate the reviews in the beginning of the class before moving onto the next problem. The Zoom recordings are also essential to me.
