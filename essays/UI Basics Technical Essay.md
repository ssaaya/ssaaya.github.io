For all of the WOD's I watched the video first just so I could see the way the professors did them. Then, I started attempting the WODs. After I attempted the WOD's the first time, I looked at my results and compared them to how it should be. I then would refer to the videos to identify my mistakes. I wouldn't time myself for the first attempts until I understood what I was doing.
This resulted in me attempting them 2-3 times, but I feel like this method worked for me because I was able to achieve Rx when I started to screen record my attempts. 
One thing I only remembered on my third WOD was that you don't need to start a http-server . request. I was getting annoyed because my page wouldn't refresh right away, but then I remembered that you could just view the file locally.
