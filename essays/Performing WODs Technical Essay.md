The Invoice1 WOD taught us how to create a basic sales invoice. We used five different example items and made the invoice by using JavaScript and HTML. You can view more deails of the wod here: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-preparing-for-WOD.html
My first attempt at Invoice1 went smoothly until I got to step 8. I had to watch the screencast solution to understand what to do because I could not understand what the instructions were saying after re-reading them a couple of times.
To prepare, I use my first attempt to practice and see what I need to study more. I do not time my first attempt because it makes it really stressful for me. When I end up watching the solution, which I had to do this time because I could not understand step 8, I usually understand what has to be done after that.
Next time, I think I will try go over the readings more in hopes that it would help me understand the instructions better.
